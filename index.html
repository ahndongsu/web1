  <h2>Web이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p>The source code was released into the public domain on April 30, 1993.
     Some of the code still resides on Tim Berners-Lee's NeXT Computer in the CERN museum
     and has not been recovered due to the computer's status as a historical artifact.[citation needed]
     To coincide with the 20th anniversary of the research centre giving the web to the world,
    a project began in dexter at CERN to preserve this original hardware and software associated with the birth of the Web.
